# Layers

Layers are used for:
- compositing multiple images
- adding text to an image
- adding vector graphic shapes
- adding special effects (drop shadows/glows)

Layer Actions
- Create
- Hide
- Show
- Duplicate
- Re-stack
- Group
- Link
- Lock
- Merge
- Flatten
- Delete

Attribute Changes
- Change blending mode
- Opacity
- Fill opacity
- Attach a mask to a layer
- Apply layer effects

A new image has one single layer. You can add as many layers to an image as you want, granted your computer's memory permits it.

You can work with layers in the **Layers Panel**.
- **Layer groups** help you organize and manage your layers by arranging them in logical order to reduce clutter. Nesting is also possible.

### Using Layers for Non-destructive Editing

**Adjustment layer** allows you to apply tonal adjustments to the layer and then layer it on top of an image you wish to adjust. This keeps from adjusting the pixels on the original image while still getting the desired result.

**Smart Object** contain one or more layers of content and can be transformed (scale, skew, reshape) without affecting the pixels of the original image.

## Types of Layers

### The Background Layer

New images automatically have a **Background Layer** - this is a "special" layer: "An image can have only one background layer. You cannot change the stacking order of a background layer, its blending mode, or its opacity".

You can convert the Background Layer into a regular layer and then change the above-mentioned attributes.

Transparent images do not come with this Background Layer.

### Image Layers

These are created when you open a digital photo or paint a picture.

### Adjustment Layers

Apply editable and removable adjustments to underlying layers.

### Fill Layers

Apply an editable color, gradient, or pattern to underlying layers.

### Smart Objects

These are created when you place an Illustrator or PDF file into a Photoshop document; a Camera Raw file into a Photoshop Document; you can also convert an existing layer to a Smart Object.

### Editable Type Layers

Created by Horizontal Type or Vertical Type tool.

### Shape Layers

Produced by a shape tool and contain vector shapes.
