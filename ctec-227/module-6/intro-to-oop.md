# Intro to Object-Oriented-Programming in PHP

`We can imagine our universe made of different objects like sun, earth, moon etc. Similarly we can imagine our car made of different objects like wheel, steering, gear etc. Same way there is object oriented programming concepts which assume everything as an object and implement a software using different objects. -- TutorialsPoint.com`

## Why OOP?
- Better for group work
- Creates a standard for coding, which unifies the way people write code; with Procedural programming, there's a million ways to do the same thing and no way is considered "wrong".
- Allows for code reusability (DRY)
- Makes larger projects simpler to build
- Easier and faster to execute
